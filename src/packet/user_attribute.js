/**
 * Implementation of the User Attribute Packet (Tag 17)<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The User Attribute packet is a variation of the User ID packet.  It
 * is capable of storing more types of data than the User ID packet,
 * which is limited to text.  Like the User ID packet, a User Attribute
 * packet may be certified by the key owner ("self-signed") or any other
 * key owner who cares to certify it.  Except as noted, a User Attribute
 * packet may be used anywhere that a User ID packet may be used.
 * <br/>
 * While User Attribute packets are not a required part of the OpenPGP
 * standard, implementations SHOULD provide at least enough
 * compatibility to properly handle a certification signature on the
 * User Attribute packet.  A simple way to do this is by treating the
 * User Attribute packet as a User ID packet with opaque contents, but
 * an implementation may use any method desired.
 * module packet/user_attribute
 * @module packet/user_attribute
