Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

As for everything else in the project, the contributions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting started

### Decide what you want to work on

If you are looking for something to work on, we try to maintain a list of issues that should be suitable for first time contributions, they can be found tagged [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/labels/good-first-issue). You can also look through our issues and pick some you like. If you're still unsure, please [reach out](#communication) and we would help you to the best of our abilities.

### Notify your interest

Please let us know you want to work on it so we can avoid multiple people working on the same issue. Ideally, notify us via our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/openpgpjs/openpgpjs), but expressing your interest in the issue itself is also ok.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

### Setting up the project in your local machine

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/openpgpjs

   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd openpgpjs

   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs
   ```

2. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Follow our [coding conventions](#coding-conventions) while developing your changes. You can also run `npm run lint` to match our requirements.

5. Write clear and meaningful git commit messages. Please follow our [commit message conventions](#commit-conventions) while committing to your branch.

6. Make sure to update or add to the tests when appropriate. Run the appropriate testing suites to check that all tests pass after you've made changes. You can read about our different types of tests in our [Testing](#testing) section.

7. If you added or changed a feature, make sure to document it accordingly in the [README.md](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/README.md) file, when appropriate.

## Coding conventions

We ensure code consistency through our [ESLint config](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/.eslintrc.js). You can run `npm run lint` to lint your changes. When in doubt, follow the style of the surrounding code.

## Commit conventions

We roughly follow the Git commit guidelines in [this blog post](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/).

Additionally, please try to follow the style of the commit messages on our [main branch](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/commits/main).

## Testing

Tests. They are located in the root [`/test`](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/tree/main/test) folder.
Before running the tests, run `npm run build` to build OpenPGP.js if you've made changes since running `npm install`.

**Unit Tests:**
To run the tests in Node.js, run `npm test`.

To run the tests in a browser, run `npm run browsertest`.


**Typescript definitions**

When changing TypeScript definitions, update [the definitions.ts test file](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/test/typescript/definitions.ts) accordingly.
Then, run `npm run test-type-definitions` to verify that it still type-checks.
(This is also automatically done for every PR.)

**Coverage**
We have good numbers but we could always use some help improving them!

```sh
npm run coverage
```

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are sa fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

If you have never created a pull request before, welcome ðŸ™‚ Read the GitHub docs on [how to create a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

1. Update your branch to the latest changes in the upstream main branch, solving conflicts if any appear. You can do that locally with:

   ```bash
   git pull --rebase upstream main
   ```

2. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

3. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and follow the instructions specified in the Pull Request template. Include a detailed description explaining the reasons for the changes, making sure there is sufficient information for the reviewer to understand your changes.

4. Check if the Github Actions workflows have passed. Address the errors if they have not.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

### I have submitted my PR, what are the next steps?

First of all, thank you for your contribution! Sit back and relax. Someone from the team will review your PR and respond with comments as soon as possible (usually within a few weeks). Once you have addressed all the comments, your PR will be approved and merged.

## Bug reports

First things first: please **do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues!** Disclose responsibly following the instructions detailed in [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/SECURITY.md). Thank you.

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in our repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What OS experiences the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

To create a new bug report, go to Issues, and select the Bug Report template.

## Communication

Feel free to reach out! You can do so in our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) or in our [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/discussions)
